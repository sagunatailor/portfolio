            <p>
              My name is Saguna Tailor, and I bring 20 years of experience in
              Front-End development, specialising in building responsive and
              user-centered web applications. Whether working independently or
              as part of a team, I take pride in fostering a collaborative and
              motivated environment. I value the opportunity to share my
              knowledge while continuously learning from others.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time, I used to enjoy traveling, those carefree
              adventures are gone now that I’ve entered the wonderful world of
              parenthood! These days, my adventures consist of gardening,
              cycling, and knitting. I’ve also become an expert at reorganising
              my house, like I’m starring in a live episode of Sort Your Life
              Out (which drives my husband mad). I’m also a big fan of Mariah
              Carey — hence all the pink on this website!

              years, during which time she has grown tremendously as a Front-End
              Developer, working on technologies like React and Flutter. She is
              very easy to work with, proactive, always willing to help, and a
              fantastic team player. Her dedication to continuous learning and
              her positive, supportive attitude makes her an invaluable part of
              any team.</span

              direct positive impact into the quantity of work delivered and the
              ways of working in the team. This new role required quite a change
              in people she was working with as well as the technologies, but
              she took in stride always with enthusiasm and positivity. The
              OnExam app rebuild would not have progressed as quickly or with
              the same level of quality without her.</span

            <span
              >Saguna has been a fantastic asset to the Onexam team. As a
              latecomer, she jumped in feet first and delved straight into the
              unknown, learning Flutter and Dart and improving daily! Her
              brilliant communication skills enabled her to immediately start
              pairing with everyone on the team, quickly getting up to speed.
              The team's momentum definitely increased after she joined. From a
              UX perspective, having a fellow BMJ engineer with excellent
              front-end skills and a keen design eye has allowed Saguna to
              tackle all the tricky, detailed UI work, ensuring the app's design
              is perfect. Additionally, Saguna has frequently taken the
              initiative to lead the team during stand-ups, which has been
              incredibly helpful.

                patience make it very easy to work as a team and develop great
                projects together. I would have no hesitation whatsoever in
                working with her again in the future or indeed recommending

                experience to cope with the many difficulties of the several
                confusing systems used for bingo content management. She
                efficiently handles a constant stream of update requests in a
                highly professional manner. She has quickly mastered the new
                Adobe CQ (AEM) content management system and has been a crucial
                factor in the successful migration and creation of several sites
                in CQ. Saguna displays huge commitment in the way she handles
                her work, not only doing what is asked quickly and to an
                exemplary standard but applying intelligence and business
                knowledge in refining requirements and proposing appropriate
                solutions. She also takes the initiative to make important
                improvements before anybody else has even noticed there is a
                problem.

              In my role, I have been responsible for the maintenance and
              development of several websites, including

              >. My responsibilities included designing and building React-based
              components and sites from the ground up, as well as deploying them
              using Amazon Web Services (AWS), GitHub Actions and Jenkins. I
              worked collaboratively with my team, managing updates to GitHub
              repositories for peer code reviews and conducting thorough code
              reviews for colleagues to ensure quality prior to merging into the
              master branch. Within an Agile framework, we effectively managed
              tasks and tracked progress using Jira, and I facilitated daily
              stand-ups and retrospectives on a rotating basis to ensure team
              alignment and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have created and updated Jest and Cypress tests for the React
              components I developed. The primary technologies I employed in
              these projects included React, CSS/SASS, HTML, and JavaScript, in
              conjunction with automation tools such as Webpack, NPM, Gulp, and
              Grunt, tailored to specific project requirements. I successfully
              managed multiple projects concurrently, which instilled a strong
              sense of ownership and responsibility for the quality of my
              deliverables. Working within Agile two-week sprints allowed me to
              meet tight deadlines effectively, enhancing my ability to work
              efficiently under pressure, adapt quickly, and independently
              maintain up-to-date skills. As a team, we prioritized continuous
              learning of the latest technologies and conducted regular
              show-and-tell sessions to share newly acquired knowledge.

              utilizing Dart and Flutter. My role involved enhancing work
              velocity and assisting with the UI/UX design of mobile app
              interfaces, which enabled me to rapidly gain proficiency in
              Flutter. Furthermore, I collaborated with and motivated an agency
              based in India to ensure the timely delivery of high-quality work.
              My attention to detail during peer reviews was essential in
              upholding the standard of our deliverables.
